I am a passionate Software Engineering Student at UTD who enjoys problem solving with a growth mindset. I am a fast learner and always love learning new things.
Right now, most of my experience is with working with web technologies like React and React Native, however, my goal is to become more multi-faceted and learn as much about both front and backend by the end of my time as a student.
